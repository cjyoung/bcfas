	<br/>
	<p>
		Enjoy Brazosport Planetarium at the Center for Arts and Sciences in Clute, Texas.  We are open for BISD High School astronomy classes, visits from thousands of K -12 from BISD and other surrounding schools and districts.  We feature both full dome and traditional public programs weekly and bring telescopes to the community through school and planetarium star viewing events. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
		Our lobby features ViewSpace, an internet-fed, self-updating, exhibit from the Space Telescope Science Institute, home of NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.  Our displays include interactive computers and 13 steps to the Universe – an ever widening pictorial view of space.
