		In the dark winter sky, the stars seem to shine brighter and whisper tales of ancient times. During February, the Brazosport Planetarium looks at "Winter's Bright Circle" and the interesting astronomy happening in the cold, night skies this month.

		<h2>Tickets: $5/adults and $3/students</h2>
		Avaliable 20 minutes before each showing.

			A fundraiser for the Brazosport Planetarium, held in the large theater, to support science education at the Planetarium and many programs offered at The Center. Teams of up to four people put their heads together to answer questions on subjects such as science, the arts, history, geography, current events and local activities. We encourage community organizations, alumni groups, church groups, family members and work groups to compete.
		<br/><br/>
			<h3>Admission is $5 at the door.</h3>
		<br/>
			The entry fee for each team is $100 and money is available for high school teams that wish to compete, but do not have the entry fee.
		<br/><br/>
