		Cosmic Colors will take you on a wondrous journey across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Discover the many reasons for color – like why the sky is blue and why Mars is red. Take a tour within a plant leaf and journey inside the human eye. Investigate x-rays by voyaging to a monstrous black hole and then back at your doctor’s office. You will even see the actual color of a dinosaur – based on recent evidence. Get ready for an amazing adventure under a rainbow of cosmic light!

		<h2>February 9 • 7 p.m.</h2>
		<br/>
			A fundraiser for the Brazosport Planetarium, held in the large theater, to support science education at the Planetarium and many programs offered at The Center. Teams of up to four people put their heads together to answer questions on subjects such as science, the arts, history, geography, current events and local activities. We encourage community organizations, alumni groups, church groups, family members and work groups to compete.
		<br/><br/>
			<h3>Admission is $5 at the door.</h3>
		<br/>
			The entry fee for each team is $100 and money is available for high school teams that wish to compete, but do not have the entry fee.
		<br/><br/>
			<h3>For more information, call Sarah Heller at 979-798-1966.</h3>
