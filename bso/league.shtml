	<h1>Brazosport Symphony League</h1>
	<br/>
	<p>
		The Brazosport Symphony League is a dues-paying organization that supports the Brazosport Symphony Orchestra and music education in the community. Prior to each Symphony concert, BSL members meet to learn about the music for that concert. During the concert, League members can be seen helping audience members find their seats and answering questions at The Clarion as ushers. They are also a welcome sight during intermission behind the refreshment counter. The League welcomes everyone who is interested in joining. Please call 979.299.6797 or 979.297.5894 for more information on League activities and becoming a member.
