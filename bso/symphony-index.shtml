		The Brazosport Symphony Orchestra is comprised of volunteers from our local community and neighboring cities. Many other volunteers support the Orchestra through the BSO Council and Symphony League. The Orchestra produces six major concerts each year:  the Family concert, Pops concert, Holiday concert, and three subscription concerts.
		The Brazosport Symphony Orchestra has a new home at
		The Clarion at Brazosport College.
