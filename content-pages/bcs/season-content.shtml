		In 1921, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and President Warren G. Harding took a camping trip together into the Maryland woods to escape civilization. What they couldn’t escape was each other. Inspired by an actual event, this comedic and dramatic clash of two great minds and one great heart of the Twentieth Century, is an exploration of friendship, politics and leadership that has surprising political relevance.

		This family holiday favorite goes beyond other adaptations with a unique dramatic concept: At the opening curtain, Charles Dickens himself is introduced to the audience, ready to present one of the famed platform readings of his stories that packed auditoriums in Europe and America. The familiar story unfolds behind him, and soon Dickens is weaving in and out of the action with short passages of rich narrative never heard in other versions.

		The decisive event in American history blazes to vivid life in this most unconventional of Broadway hits. 1776 puts a human face on the pages of history as we see the men behind the national icons: proud, frightened, uncertain, irritable, charming, often petty and ultimately noble figures determined to do the right thing for a fledgling nation.

		<br/><br/>
		Featuring all 37 of Shakespeare's plays, meant to be performed in 97 minutes, by three actors, this hilarious rendition embodies one of comedy's most essential impulses: the adolescent urge to take a baseball bat to the culturally revered. A mix of pratfalls, puns, willful mis-readings of names and dialogue, clunky female impersonations, clean-cut ribaldry, and broad burlesque, the gung-ho vitality is impossible to resist.

		A wonderful romantic comedy that delightfully mixes debutantes, social change, and a delicious helping of scandal. "The Nacirema Society takes place in Montgomery Alabama in 1964, but it’s not a history play. The sixties are not history to me. They are the years that shaped my life. Because even in the midst of all that upheaval, people still laughed, and cried, fell in an out of love, kept the family secrets, and spilled the beans.” - Pearl Cleage

		When the draft selects rock star Conrad Birdie, his fans are devastated, but none more than struggling songwriter Albert Peterson, whose song Birdie was just about to record. Albert's longtime girlfriend pushes Albert to write a new tune that Birdie will perform on television to a fan selected in a contest. The scheme works, with a young Ohio teenager declared the winner, but no one has counted on the jealous wrath of her boyfriend.
