	<h1>A Queen Size Celebration </h1>
		<p>
			The Christmas season arrives each year with a certain excitement and magic, but in the Brazosport area that magic has the power to transport guests at the Elizabethan Madrigal Feast back to a time of unmatched finery and majesty. Over the past two decades, in the small coastal town of Clute, Texas, a special guest arrives with all the pageantry expected of a royal: England’s Queen Elizabeth. The Queen will mark her 11th biennial visit in 2012 as part of an elaborate and courtly dinner at The Center for the Arts and Sciences.
		<br/><br/>
			Certainly it would be a social coup to claim that the current reigning crowned head of the English Empire would be the guest of honor at this dinner. However, the sovereign in question is actually the original Queen Elizabeth, the first, convincingly portrayed by a Brazosport area actress as part of the Elizabethan Madrigal Feast scheduled for November 23 through December 8, 2012.  
		<br/><br/>
			Originally proposed as a cultural development event in 1988 by event Chairman and designer Cheryl Fowler, the Feast has evolved as a major Fundraiser for the Brazosport Center for the Arts and Sciences.
		<br/><br/>
			The production, which is held every other year, is the intricate and exquisite creation of educator, astronomer and theater director Judi James. Along with an extended committee, James creates a Yuletide evening plucked straight from the late 1500’s, accurate to the period in every way possible.
		<br/><br/>
			“At first we didn’t know how historical to make it. Should we let people use forks? Queen Elizabeth only had 14 forks,” James said, recalling the challenges she faced in 1988, the first year of the Madrigal Feast. “We didn’t know what to expect. Everyone showed up dressed to the nines in velvet and beautiful clothing, and we made the mistake of serving turkey legs.”
		<br/><br/>
			James tossed out the turkey legs and the historical accuracy when it came to food, opting instead for an elegant dinner with a European flair befitting the Christmas season. Costumed actors serve the three-course meal, interacting with guests to draw them into the evening’s entertainment. 
		<br/><br/>
			Along with the 168 ticket-holders attending each night of the three-weekend event, historical characters populate the guest list. Actors bring to life the royal court, nobility, explorers, scientists, and adventurers from exotic lands. Waits, who were the paid singers of the time period, musicians, dancers and theatrical players decorate the space that is modeled after the main hall of Warwick Castle, the home of Sir Ambrose Dudley.
		<br/><br/>
			The costumes add a palatable sense of pageantry. Cheryl Fowler, an award-winning designer with a degree in clothing construction, oversees the army of volunteers that spend uncountable hours building the elaborately detailed costumes by historical design. “We have people who will come sew for this just to work with the fabrics,” James said. Women’s hips and rear ends are padded. Men show off their legs while the women do not. Fashionable men who lack their own beer belly are padded just as they were in Elizabethan times to give the impression of wealth. 
		<br/><br/>
			“One of the things that make this production unique is that it’s not rented. We make and build and sew everything ourselves,” James points out. The efforts are evident in the level of quality provided to each detail of the evening.
		<br/><br/>
			James herself writes and directs the script, which changes from year to year. “When the Madrigal Feast was originally proposed, I knew immediately I wanted to be involved. I looked at scripts that were already out there, but none were really the quality of what we were looking for. I thought, ‘I could write something better for this.’”
		<br/><br/>
			Between her jobs as Planetarium Director at The Center for the Arts and Sciences and teaching high school astronomy for the Brazosport Independent School District, James begins work on her Madrigal a full year in advance. The committee meets in January to set a theme. The actual writing of the script takes months of creative labor.
		<br/><br/>
			“Queen Elizabeth loved every kind of music: formal court music, Catholic Church music, Protestant, country. She had her own orchestra,” according to James. “The Arts flourished through her support. This year’s production will have a lot of beautiful music selected by Brazosport College’s choral instructor, Rodney Mason, who is also music director for our production.” 
		<br/><br/>
			The entertaining theatrical element of the evening centers on William Shakespeare’s “Much Ado about Nothing.” “This is ‘Shakespeare Lite’,” James said. “If you’re coming to see the rich, beautiful poetry of The Bard, this isn’t it. This will be the bawdier, physical part of it, performed in the Comedia del Arte style. It’s the bare story. Language that was there for its own beauty was ditched. If there is a word that can’t be immediately defined, it is gone.”
		<br/><br/>
			Of course, a fight will always break out some time during the night, whether a catfight or a sword fight. “It was a violent time. We have to have some kind of fight,” the bespeckled, mild-mannered James said with a laugh.
		<br/><br/>
			Over 200 people from the Brazosport area will turn out for the auditions. A minimum of 60 will be needed to fill the wide range of roles. Some of the actors who bring the same character to life each time have even taken trips to England in order to research more deeply their Elizabethan alter egos.
		<br/><br/>
			Behind the scenes, volunteers jockey to be part of the kitchen staff that changes nightly, some marking out dates on their calendars months in advance just to be there to help put food on the plates. Set construction crews, lighting and sound technicians are all hand-picked. The competition can be stiff.
		<br/><br/>
			The race to purchase tickets can be just as competitive. At $65 each, they don’t cost a queen’s ransom. However, they can sell out quickly. “The order in which we make tickets available is very specific,” said Orren Gaspard, Director of The Center for the Arts and Sciences. “A donation of $50 or more to the Annual Operating and Maintenance Fund by September 1, 2012 will allow you to purchase tickets to the 2012 Elizabethan Madrigal Feast before they go on sale to the general public. Madrigal reservations will be accepted as follows: Madrigal Sponsors, cast and crew, then Donors of $50 or more, then the general public." 
		<br/><br/>
			“There isn’t anything else like this anywhere on the coast,” Judi James said proudly. “The Renaissance Festival (held every October through November near Plantersville, Texas) is a completely different experience. This is an elegant, riotous, time travel experience with dinner.” It is a night fit for a king, but meant for the amusement of a queen. It is an experience not to be missed.”
